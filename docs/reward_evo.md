# Evolution of the Drone Reward Function & Constraint Shaping

This document logs the chronological evolution of our RL agent's behavior, detailing the "Reward Hacking" (local optima) bugs encountered and the mathematical/physical fixes applied to reach the final `Hunter Model` policy.

## Phase 0: Playing Possum (Lazy Local Optima)
**Behavior:** The drone realized flying was risky. It would immediately turn off its motors, fall to the floor, and simply lie flat to collect the continuous `Alive Bonus` without taking any collision penalties.
**Fix:** We introduced a strict Z-axis constraint. If the center of mass drops too low, it's considered a fatal collision.

**Code Changes:**
```python
# ADDED physical constraint
if (abs(drone_pos[0]) > hx - 0.2 or 
    abs(drone_pos[1]) > hy - 0.2 or 
    # FIX: Agent dies if it rests on the floor
    drone_pos[2] < 0.1 or  
    drone_pos[2] > hz * 2 - 0.2):
    is_collision = True
    terminated = True
    info['is_success'] = False
```

## Phase 1: The Breakdance (Effort Hacking)
**Behavior:** Forced to stay above `Z=0.1`, the agent tried to hover just slightly off the ground, often flipping over and wildly spinning its rotors against the floor to maintain height without flying properly.
**Fix:** We raised the floor death limit, added a severe penalty for tilting (Euler angles), and penalized motor effort to discourage chaotic spinning.

**Code Changes:**
```python
# CHANGED Z-limit
# From: drone_pos[2] < 0.1
# To: drone_pos[2] < 0.3

# ADDED Tilt (Euler) Penalty
if abs(euler[0]) > 1.3 or abs(euler[1]) > 1.3:
    is_collision = True
    terminated = True
    info['is_success'] = False

# ADDED Effort Penalty
effort = np.sum(np.square(action))
reward -= 0.001 * effort
```

## Phase 2: Suicide Policy (Distance Penalty > Alive Bonus)
**Behavior:** Now forced to fly smoothly and upright, the agent faced a new problem: the penalty for being far from the coin was too massive. It mathematically calculated that staying alive was a net negative, so it deliberately crashed into walls to end the episode quickly.
**Fix:** Reduced the distance penalty drastically so the agent could survive long enough to explore without bleeding points.

**Code Changes:**
```python
# CHANGED Distance Penalty
# OLD: reward -= 0.05 * current_distance
# NEW: reward -= 0.005 * current_distance 
```

## Phase 3: Ceiling Hugging (Icarus Effect)
**Behavior:** With the suicide bug fixed, the agent realized that the `Alive Bonus` was so high, and the `Distance Penalty` so low, that it didn't need to hunt for coins. It just flew straight up to the ceiling (where there are no obstacles) and safely hovered there to farm points.
**Fix:** Implemented the final **Hunter Model**. Drastically reduced the alive bonus, tied it mathematically to the distance penalty (canceling each other out at long ranges), and significantly increased the coin reward.

**Code Changes:**
```python
# CHANGED Alive Bonus (Reduced by 10x)
# OLD: reward += 0.2
# NEW: reward += 0.02

# CHANGED Distance Penalty (Fine-tuned to balance)
# OLD: reward -= 0.005 * current_distance
# NEW: reward -= 0.001 * current_distance

# CHANGED Coin Reward (Massive incentive to hunt)
# OLD: reward += 100.0
# NEW: reward += 300.0
```
